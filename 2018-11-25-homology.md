abstract: 
- Is depth needed for deep learning? In the context of model selection, this talk presents Guss and Salakhutdinov's empirical characterization of the topological capacity of feed-forward neural networks. One objective is the quantification of deep neural network complexity to enable matching of datasets to pre-trained models.

## Outline

- problem: model selection
    - fully-connected feed-forward neural networks
    - two hyperparameters: depth and width
    - this talk: binary labels
- key idea: consider homological complexity
    - we want a finite set of computable topological invariants from point cloud data-sets
    - *persistent homology* is a scale-free method for computing these invariants
        - like an imperfect fourier transform
        - the point cloud is like the signal in the time-domain, 
        - the topological *barcode* is like the decomposition in the frequency domain
- results: topological phase transitions 

## Problem: Model Selection

## Key Idea: Consider Homological Complexity

Persistent homology describes the "shape of data".

The main steps in a persistent homology analysis are as follows. We treat each data point as a node
in a graph, drawing edges between nearby nodes â€” where nearby is according to a scale parameter.
We form complexes from the simplices formed by the nodes and edges, and examine the topology
of the complexes as a function of the scale parameter. The topological features such as connected
components, and holes of various dimensions that persist across scales are the ones that capture the
underlying shape of the dataset. In greater detail:

### data

We make a minimal interpretation of the point cloud.

We'll only need single linkage clustering.

- no model, no probability
- just pairwise distances
- familiar idea: points in a metric space

### filtered cell complexes

From the point cloud, we build a filtered cell complex (think about the construction parameterized by a time $t$).

The easiest version:

- $0$ and $1$ cells are just vertices and edges
- at some time near zero, we've constructed a weighed graph where the edges are labelled with pairwise distances between points

What happens in higher order interactions? We add higher dimensional connections, a little more abstract, sufficient for computation:

Say at some time, $3$ vertices can be fit within a ball of radius $5$. Then we add a $2$-cell, a triangle, filling in the edges of the $1$-cell skeleton.

- $2$-cells are triangles
- $3$-cells are tetrahedra (they connect $4$ data points).

Then it's tricky to visualize---enter homological algebra.

### homological algebra

Like with graphs, where one has adjacency matrices recording how edges and vertices fit together, so also, each cell complex has an associated matrix recording how:

- triangles touch the $3$ edges in their boundary
- tetrahedra touch the $4$ triangles in their boundary
- and so on

So, for each complex in our filtration, we obtain a matrix. At the $0$-$1$ level, these matrices are exactly adjacency matrices, but then they quickly become more abstract. We're cataloging how cells of higher dimension fit together with cells of one lower dimension

At some point in time (in the filtration) we'll know everything we need to about the relations

0. edges to vertices
1. triangles to edges
2. tetrahedra to triangles
3. and so on

What does one do when they have a matrix?

- compute column and null spaces
- these correspond to boundary and cycle groups
- now the boundary group of dimension $n+1$ is a subgroup of the cycle group of dimension $n$, 
- the quotient group is called the $n^{th}$ homology group: it's an abelian group
- the rank of each dimension's homology group produce sthe invariants we desire: Betti numbers for each dimension $n$, measuring the number of generators for $n$-cycles
