This outline verbatim from [Julie Goedecke](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~jg352/talks.html).

### Five Steps

1. Quick read through — What is the paper about?
2. Consider — Digest what it’s about.
3. “Read around” — Gather other viewpoints.
4. 2nd read through — Solidify your understanding.
5. Nitty gritty read through — Drill deeper.

*It’s much easier to read the details in a paper when you already have a rough idea about the main message.*

### Step 1: Quick read through

What is this paper about? Main result(s)? What style of maths is needed? 

Pure Maths

- Abstract
- Introduction: in detail
- Main results
- Definitions
- Constructions

Applied Maths

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Look at pictures/graphs
- Conclusions
- Think about how they might have got there

### Step 2: Consider

- What is the paper about?
- Outline of the paper?
- Main results / theme?
- Where is the “meat” of the paper?
- Why is it interesting/important?
- Which are the bits you’ll have to “unpack”?
- Can you already see what the main message of the paper is?
- (Not nec. possible at this point: but keep thinking about it.)

Pure Maths: 5 minute explanation of proof of main result

- Can you break it down into some “sub-theorems”?
- Does the proof “translate” the problem into another area?
- Is it a “here is the construction of the thing we say exists”?
- Or is it “if that existed, then this other thing would exist, but we know it doesn’t”?

Stats: main algorithm

- What is/are the main idea(s) for the algorithm?
- Can you describe the key steps of the algorithm?
- What is the intuition for different steps?
- Intuitively, what might the conditions be needed for?
- What simple settings/examples could this be applied to?
- What results would it give?

### Step 3: Read around

- Aim: Get variety of view-points.
- Get background, earlier (easier) versions of results, context the work sits in.
- How is this paper used in other work?

    - Papers referred to in the paper.
    - Other papers by same author(s) in same area.
    - Papers which use/refer to this paper. (see MathSciNet)
    - Contributions to building up a picture.

### Step 4: 2nd read through

Pure Maths

- Read results, definitions, constructions in more detail.
- Take example/simple case along.
- Skip technical details.

Applied Maths

- Work through middle of paper
- Understand methods used 
- see which equations were used
- what approximations were made

At some point in this iteration:

- Will I stick with the essay?
- Which bits will I “unpack” further?
- What direction will I take my essay?
- Make outline.

*Take outline to essay setter: discuss.*

### Step 5: Nitty gritty read through

Pure Maths

- Look in detail at hypotheses: where used?
- Technical or “fundamental” reasons?
- Any “implicit” hypotheses?
- Consider with relaxed conditions
- “What happens if ....”

Applied Maths

- Look in detail at methods and approximations
- For which parameters does this method apply?
- When does it not apply?
